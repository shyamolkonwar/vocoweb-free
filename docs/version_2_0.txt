📘 Laxizen System Documentation v2.0
Project: AI Website Builder for Local Businesses (Multi-Page & Lead Capture) Core Philosophy: "Agency Quality Design + Business Utility (Leads)"

1. Executive Summary
Laxizen is evolving from a single-page generator to a full business solution. The system now generates multi-page websites (Home, Services, About, Contact) with embedded Lead Capture forms.
Design: Assembled from pre-built Tailwind "Legos" (Modern, Glassmorphism).
Visuals: Powered by Pexels (Realism) and Nano Banana Pro (Branding).
Functionality: Forms on user websites submit data to the central Laxizen backend, allowing business owners to view leads in their dashboard.
2. Functional Architecture
A. The "Multi-Page" Engine
Instead of generating one index.html, the builder.py module now generates a directory of linked pages.
Navigation System:
The AI generates a global Navbar and Footer that are injected into every page.
Links are relative: <a href="services.html">Services</a>, <a href="contact.html">Contact</a>.
Page Generation Logic:
index.html (Home): Hero (High impact), Testimonials, CTA.
services.html (Services): Detailed list of offerings (e.g., "Root Canal", "Whitening") with pricing cards.
about.html (Trust): Doctor/Baker bio, history, certifications.
contact.html (Conversion): Map, Address, and the Primary Lead Form.
B. The "Universal Lead Capture" System
Local business websites must capture customers. Since we host on static Cloudflare Pages, we cannot run backend code on the user's site.

The Solution: Centralized Form Handler
The Component: Every generated website includes a standard HTML form component (Popup or Inline).
The Target: The form does not submit to itself. It submits to YOUR API.
Data Flow:
Visitor lands on dentist-demo.laxizen.fun.
Visitor fills out the "Book Appointment" popup.
Browser sends POST https://api.laxizen.fun/api/leads/submit with:
website_id: "dentist-demo"
name: "Rahul"
phone: "+91 98765..."
Laxizen Backend receives data, validates it, and stores it in Supabase under the leads table.
Business Owner logs into Laxizen Dashboard and sees "New Lead: Rahul".
3. The "Modern Design" Component Library
To ensure websites don't look like generic "AI sludge," we use a strict library of Tailwind components.

🎨 The "Lego" Set (New Additions)
1. Lead Capture Components (New)
modal_popup.html: A glass-morphism popup that triggers after 5 seconds or on exit intent.
Features: "Get 10% Off" (Bakery) or "Free Consultation" (Clinic).
inline_booking_form.html: A modern, clean form embedded in the Hero or Contact section.
Styling: Floating labels, gradient submit buttons, micro-interactions on focus.
2. Service Cards (Updated)
card_pricing_glass.html: Frosted glass effect for menu items or service lists.
card_hover_tilt.html: 3D tilt effect on hover for high-end feel.
3. Navigation (Updated)
nav_sticky_transparent.html: Starts transparent, turns solid white/black when scrolling down.
mobile_hamburger_menu.html: Full-screen slide-out menu for mobile users (critical for India).
4. The Generation Pipeline (Updated Flow)
Step 1: Deep Understanding (GPT-4o)
Input: "I have a bakery in Delhi called Sweet tooth."
Extraction:
Services: Cakes, Pastries, Custom Orders.
Lead Magnet: "Get a free cupcake with first order." (AI suggests this).
Color Palette: Warm Oranges & Browns (Hex codes).
Step 2: Asset Acquisition (Hybrid)
Pexels API: Fetches "Delicious Chocolate Cake" for services.html and "Baker kneading dough" for about.html.
Nano Banana Pro: Generates a Logo (Vector style, minimal muffin icon).
Step 3: Multi-Page Assembly (Jinja2) The system loops through the page list:
Render index.html: Injects Hero, Featured Products, Popup Form.
Render contact.html: Injects Google Maps iframe link, Address, Contact Form.
Linkage: Ensures Navbar links match the generated filenames.
Step 4: Deployment
Wrangler: Uploads the entire folder (html files + assets) to Cloudflare.
Result: A fully navigable, multi-page site.
5. Dashboard Updates (The Control Room)
The user dashboard must now show value beyond just "Edit Website."

New Tab: "Leads & Customers"
Lead Table: Shows Name, Phone, Service Interested In, Time.
Action Buttons: "Call Now" (Click to dial), "Mark as Done".
Stats: "15 Leads this week", "Top performing page".
New Tab: "Pop-up Manager"
Toggle: Turn Popup ON/OFF.
Edit Text: Change "Get 10% Off" to "Buy 1 Get 1 Free".
Note: This updates the HTML and re-deploys via Wrangler.
6. Technical Specifications for Developers
API Endpoints Needed (Backend)
POST /api/leads/submit
Public Endpoint (Rate Limited).
Accepts form data from generated sites.
Validation: Must check if website_id exists.
GET /api/dashboard/leads
Protected Endpoint.
Fetches leads for the logged-in owner.
Database Schema Updates (Supabase)
Table: leads
id (UUID)
website_id (FK to websites)
customer_name (Text)
customer_phone (Text)
customer_email (Text, optional)
message (Text)
created_at (Timestamp)
status (New, Contacted, Converted)
7. Why This Wins?
Real Value: A pretty website is nice. A website that collects phone numbers makes money.
Modern UI: Glassmorphism and animations make small businesses look like big brands.
Zero Maintenance: The user doesn't need to install plugins or manage databases. We handle the form backend centrally.
