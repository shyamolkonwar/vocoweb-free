# **VocoWeb Landing Page Content Strategy**

**Core Strategy:** The "Hybrid" Approach.

* **For India:** We emphasize *Simplicity* (Voice inputs, WhatsApp integration) and *Trust* (No hidden fees).
* **For Global:** We emphasize *Speed* (30 seconds vs. 2 weeks) and *Quality* (Not generic AI).

---

## **1. Hero Section (Refined)**

*Goal: Keep the headline you love, but make the subheadline hit the "Time" and "Money" pain points harder.*

* **Headline:** Your Business Online. Just Speak.
* **Subheadline:** Stop losing customers to competitors who look more professional. Describe your business in **Hindi or English**, and our AI will build, host, and launch a unique website in **30 seconds**. No drag-and-drop. No headaches.
* **Primary CTA:** Build My Site for Free
* **Secondary CTA:** Watch Demo Video
* **Visual Note:** (Keep your existing phone mockup, but ensure the screen shows a "Book on WhatsApp" button prominent on the generated site).

---

## **2. The "Reality Check" Section (New)**

*Goal: Agitate the pain point before solving it. Address why they need a website NOW.*

**Section Headline:** Is your business invisible to 60% of your customers?

**Card 1: The "WhatsApp Only" Trap (Target: India)**

* **Icon:** A smartphone with a question mark.
* **Title:** "WhatsApp isn't enough."
* **Body:** You share photos on WhatsApp, but customers can't find you on Google. You answer the same questions ("Price?", "Location?") 50 times a day. You need a 24/7 digital receptionist.

**Card 2: The "DIY Nightmare" (Target: Global)**

* **Icon:** A clock melting or a tangled wire.
* **Title:** "DIY Builders take weeks."
* **Body:** Wix and WordPress ask you to move 1,000 pixels. You waste 20+ hours fighting with templates instead of running your business. Your time is worth more than that.

**Card 3: The "Agency Cost" (Target: Everyone)**

* **Icon:** A wallet with money flying out.
* **Title:** "Agencies are expensive."
* **Body:** Paying ₹15,000 ($500+) for a simple site is outdated. And when you need to change a price? You have to pay them again. VocoWeb is free and instant.

## **3. Features Grid (Expanded)**

*Goal: Highlight the specific features discovered in your research (WhatsApp & Brand Voice).*

**Section Headline:** Everything you need. Nothing you don't.

* **Feature 1: The "WhatsApp First" Engine**
* *Headline:* Turn Visitors into WhatsApp Messages.
* *Body:* We don't just show a phone number. We integrate a "Book on WhatsApp" button that opens a pre-filled chat (e.g., "Hi, I want to order a cake"). Zero friction for your customers.


* **Feature 2: Smart "Brand Voice" AI**
* *Headline:* It Sounds Like You, Not a Robot.
* *Body:* Most AI sites sound generic. Ours learns from you. Tell us, "I'm a friendly neighborhood bakery," and we write copy that feels warm and local, not corporate.


* **Feature 3: Vernacular & Global Support**
* *Headline:* Speak in Hindi, Publish in English.
* *Body:* Comfortable speaking Hindi? No problem. Our AI translates your voice notes into professional English (or keeps them in Hindi/Hinglish) instantly.


* **Feature 4: Zero-Touch Maintenance**
* *Headline:* Update Your Site While Walking.
* *Body:* Need to change a price or add a holiday discount? Just open VocoWeb and say, "Change the croissant price to ₹89." Done.

## **5. "How it Works" (Refined Step-by-Step)**

*Goal: Show simplicity.*

**Section Headline:** From "Idea" to "Live" in 3 Steps.

1. **Record:** Tap the mic and tell us about your business. *"I run a dental clinic in Pune called SmileCare. We open 10 AM to 8 PM."*
2. **Refine:** Our AI generates the text, images, and layout. Don't like a section? Just tell the AI to "Make it shorter" or "Change the color to blue."
3. **Launch:** Connect your own domain or use ours. Your site is live and Google-ready immediately.

## **6. Use Case Carousel (New)**

*Goal: Show versatility for both markets.*

**Section Headline:** Built for every local hero.

* **For the Home Baker:** "Showcase your menu and take cake orders directly on WhatsApp."
* **For the Tutor:** "List your subjects and let parents book a demo class instantly."
* **For the Plumber:** "Look professional on Google so high-value clients trust you."
* **For the Freelancer:** "A portfolio that looks like it cost $2,000, built in 2 minutes."
