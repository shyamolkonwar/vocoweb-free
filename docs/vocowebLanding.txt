# 1. Visual Identity & "Physics"

*The core rules that define the look and feel.*

### **Color Palette (Strict)**

* **Primary Background:** Pure White (`#FFFFFF`) for readability.
* **Primary Brand:** Deep Forest Green (`#064e3b` or similar). Use this for headers, primary buttons, and the footer.
* **Accent/Highlight:** Electric Lime or Mint Green (e.g., `#34d399`) — strictly for subtle glows, hover states, or small badges. *Never* for text.
* **Text:** Slate-900 (Nearly black) for body text; never pure black.

### **Typography**

* **Headings:** A modern geometric sans-serif (e.g., **Plus Jakarta Sans** or **Outfit**). It should feel "tech" but approachable.
* **Body:** A highly readable neutral sans-serif (e.g., **Inter** or **DM Sans**).

### **Motion & Physics (The "Modern" Feel)**

* **No "Jankiness":** All hover effects must have a `duration-300` and `ease-out` curve.
* **Scroll Reveal:** Elements should not just "exist"; they should fade in and slide up slightly (`y: 20px -> 0px`) as the user scrolls down.
* **Glassmorphism:** Use subtle "frosted glass" effects for floating cards (white background with 90% opacity + background blur).

### **Iconography**

* **ABSOLUTELY NO EMOJIS.**
* Use thin-stroke SVG icons (like **Lucide React** or **Heroicons**).
* Style: rounded corners, 1.5px stroke width, colored in your Primary Green.

# 2. Section-by-Section Blueprint

## **A. Navbar (Sticky & Glassy)**

* **Behavior:** Starts transparent. As you scroll, it gains a white background with a blur effect.
* **Left:** VocoWeb Logo (Bold text + Abstract minimal icon).
* **Right:** Links (Features, Pricing) + "Login" (Text Link) + "Get Started" (Pill-shaped Button, Green filled).
* **Animation:** The "Get Started" button should have a subtle "glow" animation on hover.

## **B. Hero Section (The "Hook")**

* **Layout:** Split screen (Text on Left, Visual on Right) OR Centered (if using a large dashboard mockup).
* **Background:** Very dark green gradient (Top to Bottom). Text is White.
* **Headline:** Massive, bold typography.
* **Subheadline:** Thin, high-opacity white (80%).
* **CTA Area:** Two buttons.
1. **Primary:** "Build My Site Free" (White button, Green text).
2. **Secondary:** "See Demo" (Transparent border, White text, Play icon).


* **Visual:** Do not use generic illustrations. Use a **"floating UI" mockup**. Show a chat bubble saying *"I run a bakery in Delhi"* and an arrow pointing to a generated sleek website card. This visualizes "Voice -> Website."

## **C. The "Problem" Ticker (Social Proof)**

* **Design:** A thin strip below the hero. Light grey background.
* **Content:** Marquee (auto-scrolling) of logos or text.
* **Concept:** Since you are new, don't fake logos. Use "Use Cases" instead:
* *Dentists • Tuitions • Salons • Restaurants • Freelancers • Repair Shops*


* **Style:** Grey text, uppercase, wide letter spacing.

## **D. Feature "Bento Grid" (The "Meat")**

* *Instead of a list, use a grid of boxes of different sizes (like Apple’s feature summaries).*
* **Box 1 (Large - Left):** **"Voice-to-Web Engine."** Visual: An audio waveform animating.
* **Box 2 (Medium - Top Right):** **"Vernacular First."** Visual: A toggle switch flipping between "English" and "Hindi."
* **Box 3 (Medium - Bottom Right):** **"Zero Tech Stack."** Visual: A code block icon with a "Prohibited" sign or a trash can, symbolizing "No Code needed."

## **E. The "Live Preview" (Interactive)**

* **Background:** Pure White.
* **Layout:** A phone mockup in the center.
* **Interaction:** As the user scrolls, the content inside the phone changes.
* *Scroll 1:* "Input: 'Bakery open 9 to 5'"
* *Scroll 2:* Phone screen flashes.
* *Scroll 3:* A beautiful bakery website appears on the phone screen.



## **F. Pricing & Offer (The "Beta" hook)**

* **Design:** Single massive card in the center. Dark Green border.
* **Headline:** "Professional Websites usually cost ₹15,000."
* **Price:** Crossed out "₹999/mo" -> **"FREE during Beta"** (in big green text).
* **List of "What you get":**
* ✓ Unlimited Edits
* ✓ Hindi + English Support
* ✓ Mobile-Ready Design
* ✓ Hosting Included


* **Badge:** "Limited spots for early access."

## **G. Footer**

* **Design:** Minimalist. Dark background.
* **Links:** Privacy Policy, Terms, Contact.
* **Copyright:** "© 2025 VocoWeb. Built for Bharat."

# 4. Implementation Notes for Developers

* **Animation Library:** Use **Framer Motion** (React). Do not use basic CSS transitions for the complex stuff.
* **Scroll Behavior:** Use `Lenis` or standard smooth scrolling CSS `html { scroll-behavior: smooth; }`.
* **Gradients:** Avoid "hard" gradients. Use "mesh gradients" or radial blurs for backgrounds to make it look premium.
* **Shadows:** Use `shadow-lg` or `shadow-xl` specifically on the white cards to lift them off the background.
