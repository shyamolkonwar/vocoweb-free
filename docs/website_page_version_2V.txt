# 📱 The "Studio" Interface Design System

## 1. Core Philosophy: "Content First, Controls Second"

The user's goal is to see their new website. The controls should not block the view.

* **Desktop Strategy:** "The Command Center" – Controls on the side or top, maximizing the preview area.
* **Mobile Strategy:** "The Thumb Zone" – Critical actions (Publish, Edit) move to the **bottom** of the screen, easy to reach with a thumb.

## 2. Mobile Layout Specification (The "Canva" Model)

When a user accesses the generator from a phone (Portrait Mode):

### A. The Header (Minimalist)

* **Height:** 50px (Very slim).
* **Left:** A simple "← Back" icon button (returns to Dashboard).
* **Center:** The Website Name (e.g., "Dibrugarh Dental Care") with a small status badge (Draft/Saved).
* **Right:** The "View Mode" icon (Toggle between Mobile 📱 and Desktop 🖥️ icon).
* **Removed:** *Do not put "Publish" or "Edit" here.*

### B. The Preview Area (The Hero)

* **Concept:** The website preview should take up the entire middle of the screen.
* **Interaction:** Users can scroll the iframe naturally to test their site.
* **Scaling:** If the user toggles "Desktop View" on their mobile phone, shrink the preview using CSS `transform: scale(0.5)` so the whole desktop site fits on their tiny screen (like a zoomed-out map).

### C. The Bottom Action Bar (Floating)

* **Position:** Fixed at the bottom of the screen (`fixed bottom-0`).
* **Appearance:** White background, slight shadow, sleek.
* **Layout:** A row of 3 big touch-friendly buttons.
1. **Regenerate (Icon: Magic Wand):** Secondary action. Ghost button style.
2. **Edit (Icon: Pencil):** Secondary action. Ghost button style.
3. **Publish (Icon: Rocket):** **Primary Action.** Full width or large distinct button. Bold color (Teal).


* **Why:** This mimics apps like Instagram or Google Photos. It’s intuitive for non-tech users.

## 3. Desktop Layout Specification (The "Browser" Model)

When a user accesses from a Laptop/PC:

### A. The Toolbar (Top Bar)

* **Layout:** Split into 3 zones.
* **Left:** "← Back" and "Site Name".
* **Center (Device Toggles):** A segmented control (pill shape) to switch `[ Mobile | Tablet | Desktop ]`.
* **Right (Actions):** "Regenerate", "Edit", and a big "Publish" button.



### B. The Canvas (Background)

* **Color:** Use a dark, neutral background (like `bg-slate-900` or the deep blue in your screenshot). This makes the generated website "pop" and look like artwork.

### C. The Device Frame (Visual Polish)

* **The Container:** Don't just show a raw square iframe. Wrap the preview in a **Device Bezel**.
* *If Desktop Mode:* Wrap in a "Browser Window" frame (Dots on top left, address bar).
* *If Mobile Mode:* Wrap in a "Phone Bezel" (Rounded corners, notch at top).


* **Why?** It builds trust. The user feels they are looking at a *real* product, not just code.

## 4. The "Edit" Mode Interaction

You mentioned users need to **Edit**. Do not take them to a new page. Keep them in the flow.

**The "Overlay" Editor:**

* **Interaction:** When the user clicks "Edit" (on mobile or desktop):
* **Behavior:** A **Side Panel (Drawer)** slides in from the right.
* **Content:**
* "Change Colors" (Color picker).
* "Edit Business Info" (Simple form).
* "Upload Logo".


* **Live Preview:** As they type in the drawer, the website preview on the left updates instantly (if possible) or refreshes when they click "Apply".
* **Mobile Behavior:** The drawer slides up from the bottom (Sheet), covering 50% of the screen so they can still see the website top half.

## 5. Technical Strategy for Responsiveness (The "Scaler")

This is the hardest part: **How do you show a Desktop website on a Mobile screen?**

If you just load the desktop site in an iframe on a mobile phone, the user has to scroll horizontally (bad experience).

**The Solution: CSS Transform Scaling**
You need a "Zoom" capability.

1. **Wrapper Div:** Create a container that is the *exact width* of the target device (e.g., 1440px for desktop).
2. **Scaler Div:** Apply a CSS transform to shrink that big container down to fit the user's actual screen width.
* *Formula:* `scale = current_screen_width / 1440`
* *Result:* The user sees the "Full Desktop Site" shrunk down perfectly to fit their phone screen, just like looking at a picture of the site.

## 6. Summary of Changes

| Feature | Mobile Design (Phone) | Desktop Design (Laptop) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Top Bar** | Minimal (Back + View Toggle only) | Full Controls (Toggles + Actions) |
| **Primary Actions** | **Bottom Floating Bar** (Easy thumb access) | Top Right Corner |
| **Preview** | Full width, scrollable | Centered, inside a "Device Frame" |
| **Editing** | Bottom Sheet (Slide up) | Right Sidebar (Slide in) |
| **View Toggle** | Shrinks "Desktop" site to fit screen | Resizes frame (Phone vs Browser) |

This design ensures your non-technical bakery owner can build, preview, and publish their site entirely while standing in their kitchen using just their thumb.
